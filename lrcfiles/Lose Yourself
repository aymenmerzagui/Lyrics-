[00:34.59]Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity
[00:43.84]To seize everything you ever wanted
[00:46.83]One moment
[00:49.08]Would you capture it or just let it slip?
[00:52.83]Yo
[00:53.83]His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
[00:56.59]There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
[00:59.33]He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
[01:02.33]To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
[01:05.09]What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
[01:07.83]He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
[01:10.59]He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
[01:13.33]The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
[01:16.09]Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
[01:19.09]Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
[01:21.33]He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
[01:23.84]He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes
[01:27.09]It don't matter,
[01:28.11]He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
[01:29.34]He's so stacked that he knows
[01:31.09]When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
[01:33.09]Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
[01:36.08]He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
[01:38.84]You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
[01:41.33]You own it, you better never let it go
[01:44.08]You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
[01:46.84]This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
[01:49.33]You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
[01:52.83]You own it, you better never let it go
[01:55.34]You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
[01:58.34]This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
[02:01.33]The souls escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
[02:04.33]This world is mine for the taking
[02:06.34]Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
[02:09.85]A normal life is boring, but super stardom's close to post-mortem
[02:13.58]It only grows harder, only grows hotter
[02:16.59]He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
[02:19.33]Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
[02:22.58]Lonely roads, God only knows
[02:23.85]He's grown farther from home, he's no father
[02:26.83]He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
[02:29.58]But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
[02:32.33]His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
[02:34.83]They moved on to the next schmo who flows
[02:37.59]He nose dove and sold nada
[02:39.33]So the soap opera is told and unfolds
[02:41.33]I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
[02:44.59]Da da dumb da dumb da da
[02:46.08]You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
[02:48.83]You own it, you better never let it go
[02:51.33]You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
[02:53.83]This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
[02:56.34]You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
[02:59.83]You own it, you better never let it go
[03:02.08]You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
[03:05.09]This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
[03:08.33]No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
[03:10.59]Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
[03:14.33]I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
[03:16.84]I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
[03:19.34]But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher
[03:22.34]Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
[03:24.83]All the pain inside amplified by the fact
[03:28.08]That I can't get by with my nine to five
[03:30.58]And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
[03:35.34]'Cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers
[03:37.84]And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
[03:41.37]And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
[03:44.58]Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
[03:46.59]See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
[03:50.34]Baby mama drama screamin' on and Too much for me to want to Stay in one spot,
[03:53.59]another day of monotony Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
[03:58.34]I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
[04:01.34]Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not
[04:04.83]Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go
[04:07.59]I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
[04:10.33]So here I go is my shot.
[04:11.59]Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got
[04:15.08]You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
[04:18.33]You own it, you better never let it go
[04:21.11]You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
[04:23.58]This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
[04:26.08]You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
[04:29.59]You own it, you better never let it go
[04:32.09]You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
[04:34.83]This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
