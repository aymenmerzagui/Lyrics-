[00:20.09]I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
[00:25.59]But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
[00:29.84]And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
[00:34.84]And you've still got it in your drawer even now
[00:50.57]Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
[00:56.32]We're singing in the car, getting lost Upstate
[01:01.57]Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
[01:05.82]And I can picture it after all these days
[01:11.57]And I know it's long gone
[01:13.57]And that magic's not here no more
[01:16.83]And I might be okay
[01:18.58]But I'm not fine at all
[01:27.32]'Cause there we are again on that little town street
[01:32.57]You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
[01:36.82]Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well
[01:47.32]Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
[01:52.33]You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
[01:58.08]And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team
[02:03.58]You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
[02:07.83]And I know it's long gone
[02:10.58]And there was nothing else I could do
[02:13.58]And I forget about you long enough
[02:16.33]To forget why I needed to
[02:24.08]'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
[02:29.33]We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
[02:33.58]Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah
[02:59.56]Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
[03:04.56]But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
[03:09.81]Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
[03:20.05]Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise
[03:25.81]So casually cruel in the name of being honest
[03:30.31]I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
[03:34.55]'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well
[03:54.76]Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
[03:59.76]I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
[04:04.51]After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
[04:10.01]Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
[04:15.26]But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
[04:20.26]'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
[04:25.01]You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah
[04:35.51]'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
[04:41.26]Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
[04:45.51]It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
[04:56.01]Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
[05:01.01]Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
[05:06.26]It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
